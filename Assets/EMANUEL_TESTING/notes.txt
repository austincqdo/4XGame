implementation order:
- hex terrain generator
- moving unit between hex tiles
- camera: moving the camera around

	- will contain sync var / sync lists

every unit should have its own script + prefab witch uses the script

Player Object


    Local Client
    - 



    Server
    - a




Units

    - player resources + player unlocks





Tiles
- terrain attributes (static?)
- territory attribute (who owns it?)
